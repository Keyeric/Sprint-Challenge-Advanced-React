- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

    In my opinion you wouldnt BUT some hooks are relatively new so many projects still use classes 
    and you have to be able to be able to work with them.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

    -render: tells the component what to put on the screen
    -constructor: creates components for render
    -ComponentDidMount(CDM): tells the lifecycle what to do next

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

    Apply stateful logic to components 

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

    to be properly prepared for use cases that you didnt plan for, to avoid bugs in your production code
